1) Gather list of interfaces under CDP neighbors
    - show cdp neighbors | i Eth|mgmt | awk '{print $1}'
      - list
2) Gather connected device information for each CDP neighbor
    - show cdp neigh interface <int_x> | beg Device-ID | awk 'FNR == 2'
      - set fact (ex. INT_X_DEVICE)
    - show cdp neigh int <int_x> | beg Device-ID | awk 'FNR == 3 {print $6}'
      - set fact (ex. INT_X_DEVICE_PORT)
3) Show int status | i <int_x> | awk '{print $2}'
    - This will display the current description of the interface
    - If it displays "--", that means it has no description
    - debug output and set as fact (ex. CURRENT_INT_X_DESC)
4) Set fact for new descriptions
    - set fact INT_X_DESC == <INT_X_DEVICE>_<INT_X_DEVICE_PORT>
4) Set interface description to match corresponding CDP neighbor
    - conf t
    - interface <int_x>
    - description <INT_X_DESC>
    - when CURRENT_INT_X_DESC == "--"
